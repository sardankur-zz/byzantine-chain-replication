1. If d is signed by rho, then is rho a correct replica? Can a faulty/adverserial replica sign d and the signature be valid?
2. On Page 4, the paper says, initially in C1 all replicas are active and all other configurations are pending. How can a non existant configuration have pending replica state? 
3. Can there be more or less number of replicas in two successive configurations?
4. Does result shuttle include order proofs and result proof or just the result proof?
5. I am unclear as to what precautions do we have if the head is incorrect, do we verify this using result proof?
