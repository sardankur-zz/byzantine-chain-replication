The testing is performed by using a separate config.txt.
Client workloads, multinode and failure scenarios are documented in each config file.

To run each file with a particular config
1. For non-multi node scenario
    python3 -m da main.da CONFIG_FILE
2. For multi node scenario
    a) python3 -m da -n MainNode main.da CONFIG_FILE
    b) python3 -m da -n NODE_NAME -D main.da CONFIG_FILE

Pesudorandom
Generates request using random number given a particular seed.
1. Picks key and value from 10 Alphabets
2. Picks slice indices from 0-3 for left, 0-5 for right

All logs are captured in byzantine.log

Below config files are briefly defined by its purpose and expected results.

1.  file : config_simple.txt
    purpose : Three simple operations : [put('movie','star'); append('movie',' wars'); get('movie')]
    expected : state of all replicas : {'movie': 'star wars'}

2.  file : config_stress_test.txt
    purpose : 2000 pseudorandom requests, 1000 by 2 clients each
    expected : normal operations and exit

3.  file : config_fail_client_req_change_op.txt
    purpose : client_request + change operation
